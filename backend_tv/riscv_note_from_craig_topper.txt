You'll probably want to enable the M extension for multiply and divide
instructions with -mattr=+m. I think clang enables those by default
with "riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu" but llc won't.

Single precision FP needs -mattr=+f. Double precision needs -mattr=+d.

The Zba, Zbb, and Zbs extensions are interesting for better bit
manipulation support.

I'm guessing the vector extension is out of scope for now?
